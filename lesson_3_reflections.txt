When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Creating a remote repository allows me to share my work with others and to make changes from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?

  I choose to pull the changes manually because when i'm working on code it doesn't change without me expecting it.
